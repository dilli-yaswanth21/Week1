Waste Management classification using CNN
Waste management is a critical aspect of maintaining environmental sustainability, and advancements in technology have introduced efficient solutions to address this challenge. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a subset of deep learning, have shown remarkable success in image classification tasks, including waste management. CNNs can be used to automatically classify waste into different categories such as biodegradable, recyclable, and non-recyclable, based on images
